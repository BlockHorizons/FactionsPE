### Installing
Grab the latest .phar file from release section and insert into your server's plugin folder. After, restart the server. See more detailed instructions [at the wiki](https://github.com/BlockHorizons/FactionsPE/wiki/Installation) :+1:

### PureChat support
There is no official support for FactionsPE. However I've made [fork](https://github.com/Chris-Prime/PureChat) which does support this plugin. 
**NOTE**: ``chat-formatter`` must be set to false in order to allow PureChat format your chat instead.
